          "Breaking Bad" follows protagonist Walter White, a chemistry teacher
          who lives in New Mexico with his wife and teenage son who has cerebral
          palsy. White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis
          of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on
           his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial
           security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime
           and ascends to power in this world. The series explores how a fatal
           diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from the daily
           concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his
           transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.
